# mongusta-scheduler
Mongo task scheduler written in Rust

# Rust Task Scheduler Implementation

## Core Features
- [ ] Asynchronous task processing using tokio runtime
- [ ] Configurable retry mechanisms with backoff strategies
- [ ] Task history tracking and status monitoring
- [ ] Distributed leader election system
- [ ] Multiple storage backends (in-memory and MongoDB)

## Architecture Components

### Scheduler Core
- [ ] Define Task trait with execution logic
- [ ] Implement Scheduler struct with:
  - Task queue management
  - Worker pool for parallel execution
  - Task status tracking
- [ ] Create TaskHandler trait for custom task processing

### Storage Layer
- [ ] Define Storage trait with CRUD operations
- [ ] Implement InMemoryStorage using RwLock<HashMap>
- [ ] Implement MongoStorage using mongodb crate
- [ ] Add task persistence with serialization/deserialization

### Leader Election
- [ ] Implement LeaderElection trait
- [ ] Create InMemoryLeaderElection using atomic operations
- [ ] Implement MongoLeaderElection with:
  - Atomic document updates
  - TTL-based leadership
  - Automatic failover
- [ ] Add leadership monitoring and metrics

### Task Processing
- [ ] Implement retry logic with:
  - Linear backoff
  - Exponential backoff with jitter
- [ ] Add task status observers
- [ ] Implement task timeout handling
- [ ] Add task prioritization system

### Configuration
- [ ] Create Config struct for:
  - Retry strategies
  - Worker pool size
  - Leadership TTL
  - MongoDB connection settings
- [ ] Add configuration file support (TOML/YAML)

### Monitoring
- [ ] Add metrics collection using metrics crate
- [ ] Implement health checks
- [ ] Add logging integration
- [ ] Create dashboard for task monitoring

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for core components
- [ ] Integration tests for storage backends
- [ ] End-to-end tests for distributed scenarios
- [ ] Load testing for performance evaluation

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up project structure with Cargo
2. Implement core scheduler functionality
3. Add storage layer implementations
4. Implement leader election system
5. Add task processing and retry logic
6. Implement configuration and monitoring
7. Write comprehensive test suite
8. Create documentation and examples
